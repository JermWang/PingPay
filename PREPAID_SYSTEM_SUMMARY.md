# Prepaid Balance System - Implementation Complete

## Overview

PingPay has been transformed from a per-request payment system into a production-ready API marketplace with prepaid accounts and API keys, while maintaining HTTP 402 (x402) support for one-off payments.

## What We Built

### 1. Database Schema (05-user-accounts.sql)
- **User Accounts** - Balance tracking with total deposited/spent
- **API Keys** - Secure key storage with SHA-256 hashing
- **Account Transactions** - Complete audit trail (deposits, spends, refunds)
- **Creator Earnings** - Revenue tracking per creator
- **Withdrawal Requests** - Payout management with status tracking

### 2. Core Libraries

**Balance Manager** (`lib/balance-manager.ts`)
- Get/create user accounts
- Deposit funds with on-chain verification
- Deduct balance with validation
- Refund capability
- Transaction history

**API Key Manager** (`lib/api-key-manager.ts`)
- Generate API keys (pp_live_xxx format)
- SHA-256 hashing for security
- Validate keys on requests
- List, revoke, and update keys
- Last-used tracking

**Creator Payouts** (`lib/creator-payouts.ts`)
- Track earnings from API calls
- Request withdrawals ($10 minimum)
- Withdrawal history
- Status management (pending/processing/completed/failed)

**Enhanced Middleware** (`lib/x402-middleware-v2.ts`)
- Dual authentication (API key + x402)
- API key flow: validate → check balance → execute → deduct
- x402 flow: unchanged from original
- Free tier support
- Automatic creator earnings tracking

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Account Management
- `GET /api/account/balance` - Get current balance
- `POST /api/account/deposit` - Initiate deposit
- `POST /api/account/deposit/verify` - Verify Solana transaction
- `GET /api/account/transactions` - Transaction history

#### API Keys
- `GET /api/account/keys` - List all keys
- `POST /api/account/keys` - Generate new key
- `DELETE /api/account/keys/[id]` - Revoke key
- `PATCH /api/account/keys/[id]` - Update key name

#### Creator Earnings
- `GET /api/creators/earnings` - View earnings
- `POST /api/creators/earnings/withdraw` - Request withdrawal
- `GET /api/creators/earnings/withdraw` - Withdrawal history

#### Protected Endpoints (Updated)
All Solana API endpoints now use v2 middleware
- `/api/solana/balance`
- `/api/solana/tokens`
- `/api/solana/transactions`
- `/api/solana/nft`
- `/api/solana/validator`

### 4. UI Components

**Balance Indicator** (`components/navigation/balance-indicator.tsx`)
- Show current balance in nav bar

- Critical warning (< $0.10)
- Quick deposit button
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

**Creator Earnings Dashboard** (`app/creators/earnings/page.tsx`)

## Key Features

### For Developers
1. **Seamless Integration** - One API key, unlimited calls
2. **No Minimum Deposit** - Start with any amount
3. **Usage Tracking** - Full transaction history
4. **Multiple Keys** - Create keys for different apps
5. **Balance Alerts** - Visual warnings when running low

### For API Creators
1. **Automatic Earnings** - Get paid on every API call
2. **Withdrawal System** - Request payouts when ready
3. **Revenue Tracking** - See total earned, available, withdrawn
4. **Transparent History** - Track all withdrawal requests

### Security
1. **SHA-256 Key Hashing** - No plaintext storage
2. **Balance Validation** - Overdraft prevention
3. **Transaction Verification** - On-chain Solana validation
4. **Audit Trail** - Every balance change logged
5. **Ownership Checks** - Users can only manage their own keys

## Database Setup

Run SQL scripts in order:
```bash
1. scripts/01-create-tables.sql    # Core tables
2. scripts/02-seed-services.sql     # Sample services
3. scripts/03-creator-tables.sql    # Creator support
4. scripts/04-marketplace-enhancements.sql  # Reviews & stats
5. scripts/05-user-accounts.sql     # Prepaid system (NEW)
```

## User Flows

### Developer Flow
1. Connect Solana wallet
2. Visit /dashboard
3. Click "Add Funds" → deposit USDC
4. Verify transaction
5. Generate API key
6. Copy key and use in apps
7. Balance auto-deducts on each call

### Creator Flow
1. Connect wallet
2. Create services in creator dashboard
3. Users call APIs → earnings accumulate
4. Visit /creators/earnings
5. Request withdrawal (min $10)
6. Receive USDC within 1-2 business days

### One-Time User Flow (x402)
1. Call API without auth
2. Receive 402 response with payment details
3. Send USDC on Solana
4. Submit transaction signature
5. Get API response

## Migration from Old System

**Backward Compatible** - x402 still works
**Gradual Adoption** - Users can try one-off first
**Existing Tables** - All original tables preserved
**No Breaking Changes** - Current integrations work as-is

## What's Different

### Before (Per-Request Payment)
- Manual payment for every API call
- Copy transaction signature each time
- High friction for developers
- Not practical for production use

### After (Prepaid Balance)
- One-time deposit, unlimited calls
- API key authentication
- Automatic balance deduction
- Production-ready for real apps
- x402 still available for one-off use

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Rate Limiting** - Add per-key rate limits
2. **Usage Analytics** - Charts and graphs in dashboard
3. **Team Management** - Share keys across team members
4. **Webhook Notifications** - Alert on low balance
5. **Auto-Recharge** - Automatic deposits when low
6. **Volume Discounts** - Tiered pricing based on usage
7. **API Key Scopes** - Restrict keys to specific endpoints
8. **Admin Panel** - Process withdrawal requests
9. **Invoicing** - Generate monthly invoices
10. **SOL Support** - Accept SOL in addition to USDC
